#### about

I am a fourth year phd candidate at the [lab of machine learning](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/gebiete/ml/welcome) at humboldt university of berlin, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Alan Akbik](https://alanakbik.github.io).
My research focuses on data-efficient transfer learning, mainly around structured information extraction.
